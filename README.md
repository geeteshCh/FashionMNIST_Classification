# Fashion MNIST classification using Deep learning

## Overview
In this project, both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Dense Neural Network (DNN) models are developed and assessed for their effectiveness in image recognition task on Fashion MNIST dataset for classifying articles of clothing based on the performance of these models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE is employed to analyse the data and assess correlations between dimensions information.PCA is also used to reduce dataset dimensions while preserving key information before feeding the data into the Dense Neural Network. The outcomes of this study reveal that the DNN model achieves an accuracy rate of 89% on the MNIST dataset, while the CNN model demonstrates a commendable accuracy of 90%. The utilization of these models on the Fashion MNIST dataset showcases their capabilities in handling complex image recognition tasks.
